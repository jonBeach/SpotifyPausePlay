# SpotifyPausePlay
This is a program written in python to control a few things in Spotify using their WEB API(spotipy).
This program listens for these keys to control Spotify:\
F13 - Pause and Play\
F14 - Volume Up\
F15 - Volume Down\
F16 - Previous Song\
F17 - Next Song\
  (I have them mapped to the macro keys on the side of my Razer keyboard using Razer synapse)

This program requires:\
If using python, python 3.8, or python 3.7\
You need a Spotify Developers app and need the Client ID and Secret that come with it\
  (Not sure if there are restrictions on the Spotify Developers app when it is first created. When I first created mine the program would   take 10 seconds to respond per request to the API but the next day till now the API responds instantly when requesting)

I have tried to work out some bugs but their are bound to be more, so if you find a bug please let me know.
